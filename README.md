## Setup production

To get a production environment running, you'll need to:

1. Create a `.env` following the `example.env` template
2. Run `npm run setup-prod` to get the prod environment setup
3. Start server using `pm2` or any other node process manager

## Setup development

To get development up and running after cloning the project, you'll need to follow 3 steps:

1. Run `npm i`
2. Create a `.env` following the `example.env` template
3. Run `npm run dev`
